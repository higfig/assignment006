If you are interesting in using bitcoin, first listen to our presentation and do research on the internet to make sure you fully understand how it works. When you get started, first choose your wallet. In general, a digital wallet is a software application, easily used on a smartphone, that serves as an electronic version of a physical wallet. Once you have a wallet set up you can begin to get bitcoins. You can get bitcoins by accepting them as a payment for goods and services or by buying them from a friend or someone near you.

<aside class="notes">
Bitcoin first entered the market at one US dollar per 1,309 bitcoins. As you can see in the chart, the coin rose slowly until 2013 when it skyrocketed to a high over $1000. Currently, one bitcoin is worth $744.81. The rates are very flexible though and change often. Bitcoins are still seen as a sound investment because their worth has been steadily increasing for the past two years.

<h1>Why use Bitcoin? Any Issues?</h1>
<img src="images/talk.png" alt="" />
<aside class="notes">
Everybody’s talking about Bitcoin these days, which is quite remarkable given the highly technical nature of the crypto-currency. But why should one use it? Many pros come along with this. Fast peer to peer transactions, low processing fees, it can’t be stolen, worldwide payments, the government can’t take your money, etc. The list goes on and on. But with some pros there has to be cons. There are some issues with bitcoin. For example: It is still experimental, bitcoin payments are irreversible, bitcoins are not widely accepted, and there is a risk of technical flaws.. People are also slow to transition to a new form of currency, especially one with no physical form, because of fear of the unknown.

<section id="the-future-of-bitcoin" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Future of Bitcoin</h1>
<img src="images/future.png" alt="" />
<aside class="notes">
As bitcoin becomes more and more popular what exactly is the future? Will it start to become a more accepted form of payment or will it dwindle amongst other currencies? What is increasingly likely is that the future of bitcoin is bright. It is the seventh year in the development of this network. It takes years to build out a protocol, which is what bitcoin is. Once the infrastructure is built, which still has many more years ahead of it, with companies like Bloq, BitGo, 21.co, and Coinbase leading the charge, we’ll begin to see solid programs built in the application layer.
